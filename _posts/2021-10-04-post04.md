#### ðŸ’¡ gotcha moments

Following [Github guides] is tricky, sometimes. E.g, a simple action like `create a branch` at step 3 may have unexpected result. Bob called and said he cannot create a branch, he did not see Fig. 3A as described in [Github guides], instead, he saw Fig.3B and could not continue.

 Fig. 3A :good: Create branch | Fig. 3B :hot_face: Find branch
 ------ | ------
 ![create branch](/assets/img/create-branch.png) | ![find branch](/assets/img/find-branch.png)
 Expect this but... | It probably means Bob has no `write` right to repo
