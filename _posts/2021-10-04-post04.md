## A helper to our team

So far, as the owner of this blog site, we have been working at local repo with confidence that the remote repo is just one command `git pog` away to be sync'ed up and published, alone. What if we decide to add an assistant to help us review posts and give some feedbacks? Our helper, Bob, has no access to our local repo so I suggest he work on Github directly by
 - create a github account
 - read this post [Post04]
 - read [Github guides] to learn Github terms like `Repo`, `Branch`, `Commit`, and `Pull Request`
 - tell me his username (so I can add Bob as a collaborator)

### A use case: Edit a file at Github repo (The remote repo)

Our policy toward a helper is trust but verify: 
 - Trust Bob to add/modify/delete any part of posts ([Open a pull request])
 - Verify Bob's work at the final step (Merge a pull request)

In order for Bob to help us proof read our blog site, he will

  1. follow [Github guides]
  1. go to source repo at [blogua10-gh-repo]
  1. create a branch `post01-bob`
  1. edit _post/2021-09-28-post01.md
  1. commit changes
  1. open a pull requet
  1. give your PR a title and write a brief description
  1. create pull request

     It is up to us, the owner, to decide when and how to act on it.
  1. merge pull request
  1. delete the branch `post01-bob` as its mission has accomplished
  1. sync back to local repo

#### Step 3 ðŸ’¡ gotcha moments

Following [Github guides] is tricky, sometimes. E.g, a simple action like `create a branch` at step 3 may have unexpected result. Bob called and said he cannot create a branch, he did not see Fig. 3A as described in [Github guides], instead, he saw Fig.3B and could not continue.

 Fig. 3A :good: Create branch | Fig. 3B :hot_face: Find branch
 ------ | ------
 ![create branch](/assets/img/create-branch.png) | ![find branch](/assets/img/find-branch.png)
 Expect this but... | It probably means Bob has no `write` right to repo

Turned out that I need to [invite collaborator] to enable Bob to my github repo. Problem solved. Also, Bob needs to accept the invitation in a week otherwise he will lose the `write` access right.

#### Step 4 cautions

When edit the file, make sure the branch name is `post01-bob` that you just created.

#### Step 5 cautions

Make sure you choose the default `commit directly`, NOT `create a new branch ...`.

#### Step 7 and 8 Cautions

Fig. 7 New PR | Fig. 8 Create PR
------ | ------
 ![new PR](/assets/img/new-pr.png) | ![create PR](/assets/img/create-pr.png)
 Click `New Pull Request` | Click `Create Pull Request`
 
#### Step 9 Merge Pull Request

Fig. 9A Merge PR | Fig. 9B Confirm Merge
------ | ------
 ![Merge PR](/assets/img/merge-pr.png) | ![Confirm Merge](/assets/img/confirm-merge.png)
 Click `Merge pull request` | Click `Confirm merge`

#### Step 10 Click `Delete the branch`

#### Step 11 Sync to local Repo

## Collaborations make sense

Collaborations are complicate. Git version control and pull request are great tools to facilitate team collaborations. I learned Git the hard way as I had not found a single self-suffice article to explain collaborations with a simpe use case. I hope this post helps.
